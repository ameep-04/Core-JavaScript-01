Q 4  Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example
ANS:-  Comma Operator (,) mainly evaluates its operands from left to right sequentially and returns the value of the rightmost operand. A comma operator is used as a separator for multiple expressions at a place that requires a single expression.
When a comma operator is placed in an expression, it executes each expression and returns the rightmost expression.

Syntax:

Expression1, Expression2, Expression3, ...so on

Example 1: The most useful application of the comma operator is in loops. In loops, it is used to update multiple variables in the same expression.

for (let a = 0, b =5; a <= 5; a++, b--) { 
    console.log(a, b); 
}
